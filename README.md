# BiscuitBlitzer

BiscuitBlitzer is an idle game built using JavaFX, featuring simple graphics and straightforward mechanics.

## Project Overview

I initially started this project as a remake of my [AP CSA Final Project](https://github.com/yash-dhore/FinalProject). Throughout the development process, I made significant improvements and expanded the gameplay experience. I have plans to add even more exciting features in the future, so stay tuned for updates!

## Features

- **Idle Mechanics**: Let your biscuit blitz even when you’re not playing!
- **Upgrades**: Purchase upgrades to increase your biscuit blitzing capabilities.
- **Dynamic Events**: Participate in special events that temporarily boost your biscuit blitzing.
- **Achievements**: Unlock milestones and hidden secrets as you play!
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitor your progress with detailed statistics.

## Future Plans
I’m working on enhancing the game. Upcoming features include:
- Graphical improvements
- More ways to upgrade your biscuit-blitzing empire
- And more!
